- Remix
- Tailwind
- Cloudeflare

## Local Dev

You'll need to copy the .env.example file to a file called .env. That contains all the env variables to run it locally.

You'll also need to set up a Supabase project to run it against and run the Prisma migrations to get the db set up.

It's a bit painful right now, but it will all get easier over the next couple of weeks.

Feel free to open PRs!
